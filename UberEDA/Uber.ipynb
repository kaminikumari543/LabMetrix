        "The objective of this project is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Uber ride request data to uncover trends, patterns, and bottlenecks in the ride-hailing process. The dataset contains detailed information on ride requests, including timestamps, pickup points, driver assignment, and ride status. Through structured data cleaning and analysis, this project aims to derive actionable business insights that can help improve operational efficiency and customer experience.\n",
        "\n",
        "Data Cleaning\n",
        "The dataset was first inspected for inconsistencies, missing values, and format issues. The key challenge was the inconsistent format of the Request_timestamp and Drop_timestamp columns. These were stored as strings in formats such as dd/mm/yyyy hh:mm:ss and were converted to DATETIME using CONVERT() in python for further analysis. Rows with missing or null values in critical columns like Pickup_point and Status were either cleaned or excluded from specific queries to ensure data integrity.\n",
        "\n",
        "Text fields like Pickup_point and Status were standardized using TRIM() to remove leading/trailing whitespaces, preventing mismatches during grouping and filtering. The final cleaned dataset enabled reliable querying for time-based and categorical aggregations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Analysis Insight\n",
        "\n",
        "1.Peak Demand Hours\n",
        "By extracting the hour from request timestamps, it was found that the highest demand occurs between 8 AM to 10 AM and 5 PM to 7 PM, corresponding to office commute times. This insight suggests a need for higher driver availability during these windows.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.Request Status Distribution\n",
        "A breakdown of ride request outcomes showed that while a good proportion of rides were completed, a significant number were either cancelled or unfulfilled due to no cars available. These two categories together represented a substantial loss of potential revenue and customer dissatisfaction.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.Pickup Point vs. Status\n",
        "Requests originating from the Airport showed a much higher cancellation rate compared to those from the City. This could be due to longer pickup wait times or inadequate driver availability at the airport. On the other hand, City pickups had a higher ride completion rate, indicating better service levels.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.Driver Unavailability Trends\n",
        "Analysis revealed that the early morning hours (5–7 AM) saw the most incidents of 'No Cars Available'. This indicates a driver supply issue that could be addressed with scheduling adjustments or driver incentives during these hours.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.Overall Completion Rate\n",
        "The project calculated an average trip completion rate of less than 70%, a clear indicator that operational inefficiencies are preventing the platform from meeting user demand consistently. Improvement here could lead to increased revenue and customer retention.\n",

        "This EDA project highlighted key operational challenges faced by Uber, particularly in terms of time-based demand spikes, driver shortages, and location-specific inefficiencies. By leveraging the data cleaning and analysis, the project transformed raw ride request logs into valuable insights. These findings can guide decisions on driver scheduling, surge pricing, location-based dispatch strategies, and service reliability improvements. Ultimately, the goal is to use data to create a more balanced and responsive ride-hailing service for both drivers and riders."
