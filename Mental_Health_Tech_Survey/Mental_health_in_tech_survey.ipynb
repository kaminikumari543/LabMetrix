It captures a wide range of information about individual demographics, work environments, and mental health treatment history. With 1,259 original entries and 27 columns, the dataset includes responses primarily from technology workers across different countries, providing a valuable lens into the intersection between mental well-being and professional life.\n",
        "\n",
        "Data Structure and Variables\n",
        "The dataset consists of 26 features and one timestamp. It contains both numerical and categorical data. The only numerical column is age, while all other fields are categorical, including important variables such as gender, country, self_employed, family_history, treatment, work_interfere, benefits, care_options, and leave. Each variable contributes insight into either the respondent’s demographic background, workplace policies, or their experience with mental health issues and support systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "Demographics: Includes age, gender, country, and state.\n",
        "\n",
        "Workplace Context: Captures company size (no_employees), presence of mental health benefits, wellness programs, and openness to discussing mental health with coworkers and supervisors.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mental Health Indicators: Includes whether the respondent has a family history of mental illness, whether they have sought treatment, and whether mental health issues interfere with their work.\n",
        "\n",
        "The comments column allows for open-ended responses, but it has a high proportion of missing values and is not used in structured analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "Data Quality and Preprocessing Needs\n",
        "Before analysis, the dataset required several cleaning steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "Gender Standardization: The gender column had over 20 different formats and spellings for gender identities due to it being an open text field. These were standardized into consistent categories such as “male,” “female,” and “non-binary/trans” for effective analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "Age Outliers: The age variable had some unrealistic values like 5 and 300 years, likely due to user input errors. These outliers were filtered out by keeping only ages between 18 and 100, which are considered reasonable working-age boundaries.\n",
        "\n",
        "Missing Values: Certain fields, especially state, self_employed, and work_interfere, had missing values. These were filled with the value \"Unknown\" to retain entries while marking uncertainty.\n",
        "\n",
        "Geographic and Industry Focus\n",
        "The majority of the respondents were from the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. The focus on technology professionals is evident from responses indicating employment in tech companies and remote work conditions. This demographic is particularly relevant because the tech industry is known for high workloads, flexible work environments, and increasing concern around employee mental health.\n",
        "\n",
        "Purpose and Usefulness\n",
        "The main purpose of this dataset is to examine the relationship between workplace policies and mental health outcomes. It can help identify factors that lead individuals to seek mental health treatment and understand how workplace support systems affect employee well-being. Organizations can use these insights to implement better mental health strategies, improve HR policies, and foster healthier work cultures.\n",
