        "This project focused on the analysis of Medibuddy insurance data, which includes customer demographics, lifestyle attributes, and insurance charges. The primary goal was to derive actionable insights to help the company improve policy planning, risk assessment, and customer segmentation.\n",
        "\n",
        "The dataset comprised two files: one containing personal details (age, sex, BMI, smoker status, region, and number of children) and the other containing policy costs (insurance charges). After merging the two datasets on the common key (Policy no.), the resulting dataset provided a comprehensive view of each customer’s profile alongside the insurance charges incurred.\n",
        "\n",
        "We started by cleaning the data: removing missing values, handling duplicates, and ensuring correct data types. Outlier detection was performed using Z-score methods for numerical variables such as age, bmi, and charges. These outliers, while extreme, provided important insights into high-risk or high-cost individuals.\n",
        "\n",
        "The analysis explored the influence of several factors on insurance charges:\n",
        "\n",
        "Gender: A boxplot analysis indicated that there is no significant difference in charges based on gender. Therefore, gender should not be a constraint when extending policies.\n",
        "\n",
        "Average Cost: The average insurance cost per policy was approximately ₹13,000–₹15,000, providing a baseline for policy pricing and forecasting.\n",
        "\n",
        "Geographic Region: Charges varied slightly by region. Certain regions showed higher median charges, potentially due to lifestyle or healthcare costs. This suggests that geographic segmentation of policies could be considered to optimize pricing strategies.\n",
        "\n",
        "Dependents (Children): The number of children showed a weak correlation with charges. Households with more dependents did not necessarily incur higher costs, indicating that this variable may not significantly impact individual policy pricing.\n",
        "\n",
        "BMI (Body Mass Index): A strong relationship was observed between BMI and insurance charges, especially when segmented by smoker status. Higher BMI often correlated with higher charges, suggesting that BMI can be a useful indicator for estimating policy risk. This opens up opportunities to offer health-based discounts or wellness incentives for customers within a healthy BMI range.\n",
        "\n",
        "Smoker Status: Smoking status had one of the most significant impacts on insurance charges. Smokers were charged dramatically higher amounts than non-smokers, validating the risk assessment criteria. This highlights the importance of continuing to collect and evaluate lifestyle data for policy underwriting.\n",
        "\n",
        "Age: Age was directly correlated with insurance charges. Older individuals tended to incur higher charges, which is consistent with the general increase in health risks over time. Age should continue to be a key factor in premium calculation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Health-Based Discounts: Based on BMI distributions, a case can be made for offering discounts to customers within a healthy BMI range (18.5-24.9). This could incentivize healthier lifestyles and potentially reduce claim rates."
