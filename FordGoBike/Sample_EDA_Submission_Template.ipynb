        "\n",
        "This project involves an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a bike-sharing dataset to uncover patterns in user behavior, identify peak usage times, and provide actionable insights for business optimization. The main goal is to understand how different user types engage with the service and how ride patterns vary across time and demographics, aiding data-driven decision-making.\n",
        "\n",
        "We began by cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and creating new features such as the rider's age. Visualizations played a key role in deriving insights from the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "The first chart analyzed user type distribution, presented as a pie chart. It showed that 88.3% of the users were Subscribers, while only 11.7% were Customers. This significant difference highlights that the majority of the service’s user base comprises long-term subscribers. This insight is useful for customer retention strategies and service personalization. It indicates a strong base of loyal users, suggesting that marketing efforts might be more effective if targeted toward converting casual users into long-term subscribers.\n",
        "\n",
        "The second chart, a bar graph showing the number of trips by hour of the day, revealed clear peak hours during morning (7–9 AM) and evening (4–6 PM) commute times. This indicates that users primarily rely on the service for daily commuting. Recognizing this trend helps in optimizing bike distribution, station maintenance, and staff allocation to ensure high availability during these crucial hours. The chart also highlighted low activity during off-peak hours (midnight to 5 AM), which could lead to bikes sitting idle, representing an opportunity for alternative uses during these hours such as promotions or dynamic pricing to increase utilization.\n",
        "\n",
        "A third chart visualized the age distribution of riders, using a histogram created from users' birth years. This analysis showed that the majority of users are in their 20s to 40s, suggesting that the service is popular among young adults and working professionals. This demographic insight can help in designing user engagement strategies, such as mobile app features or partnership promotions that appeal to this age group.\n",
        "\n",
        "Together, these insights contribute to a positive business impact. Understanding user types allows targeted marketing. Peak hour identification supports operational efficiency, while age demographics assist in tailoring services and advertisements.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, the analysis also revealed areas of concern indicating negative growth potential. Low usage during off-peak hours suggests underutilization of assets, leading to inefficiencies. Idle bikes during these hours represent missed revenue opportunities and increased maintenance costs. Addressing this issue might involve strategies like offering discounts or incentives for rides during off-peak times.\n",
        "\n",
        "In conclusion, the EDA provided a comprehensive understanding of user behaviors, time-based usage trends, and demographic patterns. These insights can guide marketing, operations, and strategic planning, ultimately enhancing user satisfaction and business growth. The project highlights the value of data visualization and analysis in identifying both strengths and growth areas in a data-driven transportation service.\n",

For instance, if subscribers have shorter trip durations, consider offering incentives for longer rides, such as discounts or loyalty points. Conversely, if casual users exhibit longer trip durations, promote features that enhance their experience, such as guided routes or special offers.\n",

For example, if certain areas show higher usage, ensure that bikes are readily available in those locations. Additionally, consider implementing features like real-time bike tracking to improve user convenience.\n",

        "User Feedback Mechanism:\n",
